Welcome to this book on Getting Started with Angular 8. Throughout this book, we will be exploring Angular 8 and how to get started building applications with Angular. We will be looking at topics such as how to set up an Angular application and how to use the tools the Angular team provide to begin developing an Angular application. We will look at the architecture of a typical Angular application and how components and modules are used to build sections of the app. We will explore ways data is accessed and passed in an app and what mechanisms Angular provides for managing data.

We will also look at more advanced topics, such as observables and RxJS, testing, and packaging an application for production. We will even take a look at the NgRx, which is a library for managing state.

In this chapter, we will introduce Angular, what it is, and the reasons it is an ideal choice for web application development, as well as go through the features of Angular and what's in the latest release, version 8.
